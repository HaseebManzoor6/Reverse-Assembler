**REVERSE ASSEMBLER**

Reverse-assemble executable instructions, from a binary file to human-readable code.

**FEATURES**

Code written for any processor can be reverse-engineered, thanks to an easy-to-learn scripting system.
Reasonably fast with optimizations planned - can reverse over 2.6 million 32-bit instructions per second!

**TO DO**
- Documentation and examples
- Re-assembling source code
- Optimizations
